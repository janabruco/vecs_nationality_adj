# vecs_nationality_adj

This project explores the similarity between nationality adjectives using GloVe word vectors.

## Data Source
The list of nationality adjectives is derived from the languages-list-EN dataset, curated by Natasha Bernal. The source file is available on GitHub:
langs-EN.json.

## Scope of Adjectives
While most adjectives in the dataset represent nationalities, some refer to cultural or linguistic identities, such as Catalan, Mandarin, and Cantonese. For simplicity and to avoid confusion with language names, these terms are collectively referred to as "nationality adjectives" throughout the project.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to analyze and investigate the relationships and similarities between these adjectives within the GloVe embedding space, providing insights into their semantic connections.
